<h3 align='center'> A GUI Tool Kit for Students to Manage their Degree Plan and Courses </h3>

___  

This project was originally developed for our Software Engineering course. 
The intention of this project was to practice the software development life-cycle, 
software development practices, and different-but-related methodologies.  

The Scrum model suggests that projects progress via a series of sprints.  
In keeping with an agile methodology, sprints are timeboxed to 
no more than a month long, most commonly two weeks.

Scrum methodology advocates for a planning meeting at the start of the sprint,
where team members figure out how many items they can commit to, 
and then create a sprint backlog â€“ a list of the tasks to perform during the sprint.
